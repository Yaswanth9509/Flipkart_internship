##  Overview

This project implements a **custom sales data pipeline** that ingests, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes sales-related data from multiple sources: **CSV, JSON, and Excel**.

It is designed to be:
-  Modular  
-  Insight-rich  
-  Visualization-capable  
-  Extensible for large-scale or real-time pipelines  

---

##  File Structure

```plaintext
Sales_Data_Pipeline_Main.py      # Main Python script with the complete pipeline
custom_merged_data.csv           # Auto-generated merged dataset (output)
auto_insights_dashboard.png      # Auto-generated visualizations (output)
custom_insights_report.txt       # Auto-generated insights (output)
```

---

##  Features

-  Multi-source data loading (CSV, JSON, Excel)
-  Auto-cleaning and type conversion
-  Smart merging using auto-detected keys
-  Insight extraction: stats, revenue, category analysis, time series
-  Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, time plots, correlation matrix
-  Exports: Merged CSV, PNG dashboard, Text report
-  Custom handling for quirky real-world datasets

---

##  Requirements

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tabulate openpyxl
```

---

##  Usage

### 1. Configure Your File Paths

Edit the following in the `__main__` block:

```python
your_csv_file = r"path\to\your\sales_data.csv"
your_json_file = r"path\to\your\product_metadata.json"
your_excel_file = r"path\to\your\region_info.xlsx"
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline

```bash
python Sales_Data_Pipeline_Main.py
```

You will be prompted whether to generate visualizations.

##  Output Files

After successful execution, you’ll get:
- `custom_merged_data.csv`: Merged, cleaned dataset
- `custom_insights_report.txt`: Readable report with stats and findings
- `auto_insights_dashboard.png`: Visual dashboard

---

##  Example Insights Extracted

- Total records, column types
- Financial summary: total revenue, average cost, etc.
- Top categories by count
- Daily performance over time
- Strong correlations between metrics

---

##  Sample Visuals

- Sales over time plot
- Category distribution
- Revenue distribution histogram
- Correlation heatmap

---

##  Error Handling

The pipeline uses specific exceptions:
- Handles missing or corrupt files gracefully
- Warns about unsupported formats or merge conflicts
- Logs failed conversions per column

---
